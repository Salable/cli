# Getting Started

To get started with the Salable CLI, install it globally using `npm i -g @salable/cli`. Then authenticate with your Salable account using `salable auth` in your terminal.

After authentication is complete, you can use `salable switch organisation` to change between organisations you have acess to. You can also use the `salable switch mode` command to switch between "test" and "live" mode in your Salable account.

You're then ready to run your first commands using the Salable CLI!
